## Contributing

You can add new features, or fix bugs founded on mintbase-js packages.

For new template examples we recommend to open a P/R to add a new folder on our [templates repository](https://github.com/Mintbase/templates)


### Branching

 **Beta branch**

This is the default branch and will be equal the latest official release.

 **Dev Branch**

This is the branch for development used by the team and/or other contributors from the community. New features, fixes and other improvements are first implemented and tested in this branch. When adding new features/fixes team members must always create a new branch locally based on latest changes of dev branch. When your work is ready a merge request should be opened from your branch to dev. When your PR is reviewed and approved then it can be merged.

 **Other branches**

Except main and dev branch other branches are work in progress by the team or related to the open PR(s).

### Criteria
 1. The code to be accepted can't break existing code and features.
 2. It should feature original code and not be copied from existing sources.
