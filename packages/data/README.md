# Fetching Data From the Indexer

For as long as we have had an indexer, we have relied on GraphQL to provide builders with a flexible and efficient way to query data any way they like.

While we will continue to provide public and tailored schema objects, we will begin to introduce helper methods here that can be used to query data **without having to write any graphql**.

For now, reference our [existing graphql docs](https://docs.mintbase.io/dev/read-data/mintbase-graph) and be sure to check back here soon for updates to our data layer APIs.
