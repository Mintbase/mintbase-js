# Testing Library

The mintbase testing library contains utility methods as well as integration tests that allow us to perform calls on our deployed smart contracts as common workflows e.g. [transfer](src/tests/transfer.ts).

Naturally, we encourage everyone to test the workflows they build using the SDK.

We will continue to some of the methods we do so here.
